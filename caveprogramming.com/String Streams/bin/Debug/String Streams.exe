 * If the GL library is loaded at runtime with SDL_GL_LoadLibrary(), then all

 * function pointers to OpenGL extensions.
 *
 * There are some quirks to looking up OpenGL functions that require some
 * extra care from the application. If you code carefully, you can handle
 * these quirks without any platform-specific code, though:
 *
 * - On Windows, function pointers are specific to the current GL context;
 *   this means you need to have created a GL context and made it current
 *   before calling SDL_GL_GetProcAddress(). If you recreate your context or
 *   create a second context, you should assume that any existing function
 *   pointers aren't valid to use with it. This is (currently) a
 *   Windows-specific limitation, and in practice lots of drivers don't suffer
 *   this limitation, but it is still the way the wgl API is documented to
 *   work and you should expect crashes if you don't respect it. Store a copy
 *   of the function pointers that comes and goes with context lifespan.
 * - On X11, function pointers returned by this function are valid for any
 *   context, and can even be looked up before a context is created at all.
 *   This means that, for at least some common OpenGL implementations, if you
 *   look up a function that doesn't exist, you'll get a non-NULL result that
 *   is _NOT_ safe to call. You must always make sure the function is actually
 *   available for a given GL context before calling it, by checking for the
 *   existence of the appropriate extension with SDL_GL_ExtensionSupported(),
 *   or verifying that the version of OpenGL you're using offers the function
 *   as core functionality.
 * - Some OpenGL drivers, on all platforms, *will* return NULL if a function
 *   isn't supported, but you can't count on this behavior. Check for
 *   extensions you use, and if you get a NULL anyway, act as if that
 *   extension wasn't available. This is probably a bug in the driver, but you
 *   can code defensively for this scenario anyhow.
 * - Just because you're on Linux/Unix, don't assume you'll be using X11.
 *   Next-gen display servers are waiting to replace it, and may or may not
 *   make the same promises about function pointers.
 * - OpenGL function pointers must be declared `APIENTRY` as in the example
 *   code. This will ensure the proper calling convention is followed on
 *   platforms where this matters (Win32) thereby avoiding stack corruption.
 *

 * Dynamically load the Vulkan loader library.
 *
 * This should be called after initializing the video driver, but before
 * creating any Vulkan windows. If no Vulkan loader library is loaded, the
 * default library will be loaded upon creation of the first Vulkan window.
 *
 * It is fairly common for Vulkan applications to link with libvulkan instead
 * of explicitly loading it at run time. This will work with SDL provided the
 * application links to a dynamic library and both it and SDL use the same
 * search path.
 *
 * If you specify a non-NULL `path`, an application should retrieve all of the
 * Vulkan functions it uses from the dynamic library using
 * SDL_Vulkan_GetVkGetInstanceProcAddr unless you can guarantee `path` points
 * to the same vulkan loader library the application linked to.
 *
 * On Apple devices, if `path` is NULL, SDL will attempt to find the
 * `vkGetInstanceProcAddr` address within all the Mach-O images of the current
 * process. This is because it is fairly common for Vulkan applications to
 * link with libvulkan (and historically MoltenVK was provided as a static
 * library). If it is not found, on macOS, SDL will attempt to load
 * `vulkan.framework/vulkan`, `libvulkan.1.dylib`,
 * `MoltenVK.framework/MoltenVK`, and `libMoltenVK.dylib`, in that order. On
 * iOS, SDL will attempt to load `libMoltenVK.dylib`. Applications using a
 * dynamic framework or .dylib must ensure it is included in its application
 * bundle.
 *
 * On non-Apple devices, application linking with a static libvulkan is not
 * supported. Either do not link to the Vulkan loader or link to a dynamic
 * library version.
